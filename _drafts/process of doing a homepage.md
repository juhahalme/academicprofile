<!-- 1500 - 2000 words -->

In this post I document my personal process for doing my academic homepage and share some resources that I found helpful. The reason why I'm doing this partly personal, as I want to keep some kind of organized note for myself, but hopefully also offer some useful tips/references for collegues that might be interested of making their own website. 

As a disclaimer, this should not be taken as "tutorial" per se, as I'm most certainly not expert in this topic, and are better sources for that (which some I have included in this post). Secondly, I use MacOS as my operating system, so some parts of these instructions might not be valid in other operating systems.

2. Github-pages
Github-pages is very good hosting service for simple sites like academic homepage, which does not require any heavy assests. 


However, I had lot of issues of getting Jekyll to work in my computer, which related to the getting Ruby 


As a final reflection, as a person who had their last homepage in Geocities (maybe old-timers remember that), I found the whole process quite difficult and time consuming. However, it was also very useful to learn new things about jekyll, git, github, domain names, and so forth. 

That being said, the process was not that easy but required lot of learning about creating, hosting, domain names, and so forth. I originally anticipated, and required rather lot of learning and
