I'm a Finnish social scientist currently employed at the [Karelian Institute](https://www.uef.fi/en/unit/karelian-institute) of the [University of Eastern Finland](https://www.uef.fi/) as a postdoctoral researcher in Horizon Europe project [RUSTIK](https://rustik-he.eu/) (_Rural Sustainability Transitions through Integration of Knowledge for improved policy processes_). My [doctoral dissertation](https://erepo.uef.fi/handle/123456789/23804) (2020) concentrated on stakeholder collaboration in regional level place marketing projects. My recent academic interests include sustainability transitions, regional and rural policy, and inter-organizational collaboration in the context of [living labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_lab). My previous work has been presented at various [international conferences]({% link presentations.md %}) and published in journals, such as Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space, Qualitative Market Research, Place Branding and Public Diplomacy, and Journal of Place Management and Development.
